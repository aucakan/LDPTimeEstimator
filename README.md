# Generalization of Attributes & Record-level Local Differential Privacy: Execution Time Estimation Tool
This tool estimates the total runtime of record-level Local Differential Privacy (LDP) protocols after domain generalization. My research group and I can input the domain size and number of trials to compute and compare the expected durations of perturbation and estimation in GRR, SS, BLH, OLH, RAPPOR, and OUE.

It is specifically designed to help our research group easily predict how long an experiment will take under various domain generalizations â€” without relying on external computation tools.
