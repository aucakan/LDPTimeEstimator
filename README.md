# LDP-ETE
This tool estimates the total runtime of record-level Local Differential Privacy (LDP) protocols after domain generalization. My research group and I can input the domain size and number of trials to compute and compare the expected durations of perturbation and estimation in GRR, SS, BLH, OLH, RAPPOR, and OUE.
